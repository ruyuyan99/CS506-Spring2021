# Starter Code

1. Download the data from Kaggle into a the `data/` folder
2. Run `initial-exploration.py` to print the first few rows of `train.csv` and `test.csv` and view their shapes
2. Run `generate-Xtrain-Xtest.py` to generate `X_train.csv` which you will use to learn the model and `X_test.csv` which you will use to apply your model and generate your predictions for grading
3. Run `predict-constant.py` to predict the same score for all rows in the testing set
5. Run `predict-knn.py` to predict the score using KNN

Good luck!
